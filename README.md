# DiffUS - Differentiable Ultrasound from MRI

**Authors:** Noé Bertramo, Gabriel Duguey  
**Institution:** Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)  
**Date:** Spring 2025  
**Dataset:** [ReMIND2Reg](https://doi.org/10.7937/3RAG-D070)  
**Keywords:** Fast Differentiable Simulation · Ultrasound Imaging · MRI · Registration · Alignement

This project investigates the **differentiable simulation of 2D ultrasound images from 3D MRI volumes** by modeling wave propagation through soft tissues.  
The goal is to learn a differentiable forward model of ultrasound generation that allows **training on paired MRI/US data** to eventually **recover the source position** or other acquisition parameters through backpropagation.

## File Naming Convention in the ReMIND2Reg dataset

| File suffix       | Modality           | When acquired    | Purpose                          |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| `_0000.nii.gz`    | 3D ultrasound (iUS) | During surgery   | After tumor resection            |
| `_0001.nii.gz`    | MRI - ceT1          | Before surgery   | Contrast-enhanced, structural    |
| `_0002.nii.gz`    | MRI - T2-SPACE      | Before surgery   | Non-contrast, structural         |

Each file is a **3D matrix of size `256×256×256`** representing the brain volume in 3D space, with **0.5 mm voxel spacing**.

About the contents of the github: as this project is still ongoing, the files are a little bit rough aruond the edges. Interesting files in notebooks and src include:

notebooks:
- [DEMO] REUBEN DATA * : rendering of our ray propagation model through RemindReg datasets (these are result files)
- [DEMO] Modeling Choices : demo of our ray propagation model
- [DEMO] Train MRI to Impedance MLP - GPU: simple MLP to try and backprop to the correct MRI -> Acoustic Impedance function.

src:
- renderer.py: main logic file. The plot_beam_frame function is the one responsible for the rendering.
- cone.py / utils.py: utility files with little useful functions
